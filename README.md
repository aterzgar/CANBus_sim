# CAN Bus Vehicle Simulation System

This project is a simulation tool for vehicle systems using a CAN bus communication framework. It features a graphical dashboard interface that allows real-time monitoring and control of vehicle states, making it ideal for testing and educational purposes.

## Features

- **CAN Handler**: Manages CAN communication, processes vehicle data, and sends/receives messages using a virtual CAN network.
- **Dashboard GUI**: A user-friendly graphical interface to monitor key vehicle parameters such as speed, RPM, ignition status, engine state, brake activity, gear position, and door locks.
- **Vehicle State Management**: Handles the internal state of the vehicle, including gear shifting, turn signals, and debug mode toggles.

This project is designed to be modular and interactive, providing an engaging way to explore CAN bus communication and vehicle system simulations.
